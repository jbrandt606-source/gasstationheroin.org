          <h2>What is Kratom?</h2>
          <p><strong>Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)</strong> is a tropical plant from Southeast Asia that contains psychoactive alkaloids — especially <strong>mitragynine</strong>. In the U.S., it’s sold unregulated in vape shops, gas stations, and online as a powder, capsule, tea, or “energy” shot. Mitragynine acts on the brain’s opioid receptors, producing stimulant or sedative effects depending on the dose. Kratom use can cause dependence, withdrawal, and overdose-like toxicity. It is not approved for any medical use by the FDA and has been linked to seizures, liver damage, and death.</p>

          <h2>What is 7-OH?</h2>
          <p><strong>7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</strong> is a metabolic byproduct of mitragynine — and also found in small amounts in some kratom products. It is <strong>far more potent</strong> at opioid receptors than morphine. 7-OH is responsible for most of kratom’s narcotic-like effects. Some manufacturers spike products with synthetic 7-OH and label it as a “premium” or “enhanced” formulation. 7-OH is directly associated with respiratory depression, overdose, and hospitalizations requiring naloxone reversal.</p>

          <h2>Why a 7-OH Ban Isn’t Enough</h2>
          <p>While 7-OH is the most potent opioid in kratom, <strong>most serious health effects — including fatalities — are caused by mitragynine</strong> itself. Mitragynine converts to 7-OH in the liver, especially when users concentrate kratom by boiling it into a tea or reducing it into a resin. The majority of kratom-related deaths involve unmodified kratom powders and capsules, not products that were labeled “7-OH.” If legislation only targets 7-OH, the core public health risk remains on store shelves.</p>
