          <h2>What is Kratom?</h2>
          <p><strong>Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)</strong> is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. Its leaves contain psychoactive alkaloids, primarily <strong>mitragynine</strong>, which interacts with opioid receptors in the brain. Kratom is sold as a powder, capsule, liquid, or resin extract in gas stations, vape shops, and online. At low doses, it may act as a stimulant. At higher doses, it can produce opioid-like sedation and carry risks of <strong>tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal</strong>. It is not approved by the FDA for any use, and has been associated with seizures, liver toxicity, and death.</p>

          <h2>What is 7-OH?</h2>
          <p><strong>7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</strong> is a metabolite of mitragynine — and a much more potent opioid agonist. Some kratom products are spiked with synthetic 7-OH or marketed to highlight its presence, making them significantly riskier. 7-OH can lead to respiratory depression, overdose, and hospitalizations. Some formulations sold as <em>K-shot</em>, <em>OPMS</em>, or <em>7Tabz</em> have been linked to serious adverse events requiring naloxone reversal.</p>

          <h2>Why a 7-OH Ban Isn’t Enough</h2>
          <p>Most kratom-related deaths and poisonings involve <strong>plain kratom powders or capsules</strong> — not just the 7-OH-enriched products. The body naturally converts mitragynine into 7-OH during liver metabolism, especially when kratom is brewed into teas or reduced into resin extracts. Restricting only 7-OH leaves the unregulated kratom industry free to sell opioid-class alkaloids without safety controls.</p>
