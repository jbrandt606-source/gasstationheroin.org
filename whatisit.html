      <h2>What is Kratom?</h2>
      <p><strong>Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)</strong> is an unregulated plant sold in gas stations and vape shops as powders, capsules, drinks, and “shots.” It contains <strong>mitragynine</strong>, a compound that binds to opioid receptors and mimics narcotic effects. Kratom use can lead to tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms including nausea, anxiety, and tremors. The CDC and FDA have linked kratom to seizures, liver injury, and thousands of adverse event reports — including fatalities. It is not approved as a dietary supplement or drug, yet is often sold with health claims.</p>

      <h2>What is 7-OH?</h2>
      <p><strong>7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</strong> is a metabolite and chemical relative of mitragynine that is many times more potent. It acts directly on μ-opioid receptors with effects comparable to morphine. Some kratom products are chemically enriched with 7-OH and advertise it on the label — increasing the risk of overdose, especially in adolescents. Case reports show that 7-OH exposure has resulted in intubation, coma, respiratory depression, and hospitalizations requiring naloxone reversal.</p>

      <h2>Why a 7-OH Ban Isn’t Enough</h2>
      <p>While 7-OH is dangerous, most kratom-related deaths involve <strong>unmodified kratom products</strong> where mitragynine — not 7-OH — is the primary toxic agent. National poison center data and medical examiner reports confirm that <strong>the plant itself and its main alkaloid, mitragynine, cause dependence, hospitalization, and death</strong>. Regulating only 7-OH allows dangerous kratom powders, capsules, and shots to remain legal and accessible in convenience retail. To reduce harm, lawmakers must address the full spectrum of kratom products — not just one metabolite.</p>
