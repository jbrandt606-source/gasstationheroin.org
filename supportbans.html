  <h1>Support Kratom Bans</h1>

  <p>Kratom and its active alkaloids are associated with increasing rates of poisonings, hospitalizations, and deaths — yet these products remain unregulated in many states. MAHA supports efforts to restrict the sale and marketing of kratom through statewide bans, scheduling, or emergency actions. Here's why:</p>

  <h2>Key Harm Statistics</h2>
  <ul class="stats-list">
    <li>CDC SUDORS reported <strong>1,151 kratom-related deaths</strong> in 2023 alone.</li>
    <li>Florida Medical Examiner Commission listed <strong>516 kratom-caused deaths</strong> from 2020–2023.</li>
    <li>NPDS poison centers logged <strong>10,272 kratom exposures</strong> from 2014–2023 — <strong>45% required hospitalization</strong>.</li>
    <li>FDA FAERS includes <strong>1,437 adverse events</strong> linked to kratom — <strong>707 involved death</strong>.</li>
    <li>FDA CAERS confirms <strong>189 hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>188 cases of dependence</strong> from kratom products.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="policy-note">
    <strong>Important Policy Note:</strong><br>
    Targeting only <em>7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</em> in regulation is insufficient. The overwhelming majority of kratom-related poisonings, hospitalizations, and deaths are caused by the full kratom plant and its primary alkaloid, <strong>mitragynine</strong> — not isolated 7-OH. A partial ban would leave the core public health threat untouched.
