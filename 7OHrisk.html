      <h3>What Makes 7-OH Dangerous?</h3>
      <p><strong>7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</strong> is the most potent opioid-acting alkaloid in kratom. It binds strongly to μ-opioid receptors and can cause respiratory depression, withdrawal, and overdose-like effects. Although it’s present in small amounts in the plant, some manufacturers enrich products with synthetic 7-OH or label the content to suggest potency. The FDA has linked 7-OH to serious events including coma, naloxone reversal, and pediatric exposure hospitalizations.</p>

      <h3>Why Concentrating Kratom Increases 7-OH</h3>
      <p><strong>Home-made kratom extracts, teas, and resins</strong> can increase the bioavailability of 7-OH inside the body. When users boil or reduce kratom powder to concentrate it, they are also setting the stage for more 7-OH to be produced during liver metabolism. This increases the risk of overdose-like effects — even when using raw kratom leaf. Many users unknowingly convert mitragynine into high levels of 7-OH internally through this method.</p>

      <h3>A 7-OH Ban Isn’t Enough</h3>
      <p>Banning only 7-OH ignores the root problem. The vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths involve <strong>plain kratom products</strong> with high mitragynine content — not pre-spiked 7-OH shots. Poison center and medical examiner data confirm that mitragynine alone is dangerous and addictive. Restricting 7-OH while leaving raw kratom powders and capsules legal would fail to address the widespread harm already occurring.</p>
