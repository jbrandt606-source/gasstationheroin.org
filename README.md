# GasStationHeroin.org  
**A public-health awareness project by [Mothers Against Herbal Abuse (MAHA)](https://www.mothersagainstherbalabuse.org)**

This repository hosts the static microsite for **GasStationHeroin.org**, a focused campaign warning parents, communities, and lawmakers about kratom — an addictive, opioid-like substance often marketed as a “natural supplement” and sold openly in gas stations and vape shops.

### 🎯 Purpose
- Educate parents about the risks of kratom and its marketing as “gas station heroin.”
- Centralize links to MAHA’s evidence pages: FDA FAERS, CDC, poison-control data, and state legislative actions.
- Encourage safe disposal, awareness campaigns, and letters to lawmakers.
