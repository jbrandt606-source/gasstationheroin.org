          <h2>What Makes 7-OH Dangerous?</h2>
          <p><strong>7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</strong> is the most potent opioid-acting alkaloid in kratom. It binds directly to μ-opioid receptors and can cause respiratory depression, withdrawal, and overdose-like effects. Though naturally present in trace amounts, some manufacturers concentrate it or falsely advertise its strength. FDA data link 7-OH to coma, intubation, pediatric exposures, and naloxone-reversed poisonings.</p>

          <h2>Why Kratom Teas and Extracts Increase 7-OH</h2>
          <p>When users <strong>boil, simmer, or reduce kratom powder</strong> into concentrated teas or resins, they dramatically increase the dose of <strong>mitragynine</strong> — which is then metabolized by the liver into 7-OH. This internal conversion is unpredictable and potentiates the same opioid effects seen with synthetic opioids. Homemade extracts unknowingly increase the body’s exposure to 7-OH, even without a product containing it directly.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2>Opioid-Class Effects</h2>
          <p>Both mitragynine and 7-OH activate the brain’s opioid receptors. <strong>7-OH is significantly more potent</strong> and acts faster, making it more likely to trigger sedation, respiratory suppression, and physical dependence. Case studies document withdrawal symptoms requiring <strong>buprenorphine, naloxone, and hospitalization</strong>.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2>Labeling & “Spiked” Products</h2>
          <p>Some kratom brands <strong>intentionally enrich products with 7-OH</strong> or label them as “enhanced.” These are sold as liquid shots, gummies, or tablets — often branded as <em>OPMS Black</em>, <em>7Tabz</em>, or <em>K-Shot</em>. These high-potency formats are often flavored and marketed toward young users and carry significant overdose risk.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2>Why a 7-OH Ban Isn’t Enough</h2>
          <p>The majority of poison center cases and kratom-related deaths involve products <strong>without added 7-OH</strong>. Ordinary powders and capsules, metabolized naturally, produce 7-OH inside the body. If only 7-OH is banned, the kratom industry will continue selling dangerous, opioid-class products through vape shops and gas stations.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h2>What the Data Shows</h2>
          <p><strong>CDC SUDORS</strong> dashboards show over <strong>3,000 kratom-related deaths</strong> since 2020. <strong>Poison control centers</strong> report more than <strong>10,000 kratom exposure calls</strong>, with nearly half resulting in hospitalization. The FDA has repeatedly warned that both kratom and 7-OH have “opioid-like effects and carry serious risk.”</p>
